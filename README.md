# Class-Project-Groups
Brief Summary - This code provides for the creation of groups of two people in a class of n people where n is even. Each person works with each other person exactly once over the course of the class.

In-Depth Summary
  This code is part of a larger project. The idea is that for a class of students you want them to learn to collaborate with each other. Also, to build real world skills you want the students to work on a series of projects rather than a worksheet of math problems. 
  To that end this code will take in a parameter n (which must be even) and output a matrix. Each of the 2n-1 rows of the matrix indicates a set of n/2 pairings. When taken together the sum of the pairings allows each student to work with each other student exactly once in a group of two. As such it is intended that once a row is used it should be excluded from further consideration (unless all rows are to be used the same (multiple) number of times. This allows students to learn about collaboration with a variety of others people.
